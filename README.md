# Additional Resources

Anything that might be interesting or useful to the club not directly related to a project.
- you can add your stuff to the README.md or a new folder

- A while ago I found a pdf with a bunch of circuits snippets from a guitar pedal designer. It might be cool to try some of these out
- here's the full pdf:[Circuit Snippets.pdf](https://github.com/Lakehead-Georgian-Electronics-Club/Cool-Stuff/files/9964151/Circuit.Snippets.pdf)

Heres some examples(more in the pdf):
